# impFactory Example with Agent

## This Example shows how to

* Use the Factory Tools library to determine if we are running in a factory environment
* Use the impFactory IR output to bless devices
* Run a test before blessing
* Use factory agents to deliver device information from the Device Under Test to an external webhook and also back to the Factory Fixture to display on the Fixture's LCD
* Use the "exit" button to reset the LCD display to welcome message
